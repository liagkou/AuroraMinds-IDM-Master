The *rest-wrapper* is a wrapper for the client-code to allow usage of the functionality directly through REST calls. To build the module, use the command in the cfp-usecase directory:

>mvn install

*Note that this module depends on the core module, so this may trigger (if the core module has not been built previously, or has been changed) the build of that module (more information in the corresponding [readme](../core/README.md)).
